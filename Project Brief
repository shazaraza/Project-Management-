We have recently engaged with a new customer with the intention of securing an enterprise licence and delivering a suite of rating models.  The customer is a major multinational insurance company with presence in London, New York and Bermuda.

They have asked us to provide them with access to the platform, integrate with their architecture, enhance our platform capabilities to meet their specific use cases and develop 6 rating models on our platform. They have the ambition to be at the cutting edge of insurance pricing and are investing heavily in a number of different workstreams to support this ambition.  They want to free up their underwriters to focus on value-add activities and reduce manual intervention and data entry.

We need to design a programme of work to:

- Provide a detailed estimate of capacity and type of capacity needed to deliver this
- Understand the specific customer requirements & use cases
- Understand how their underwriters intend to use the platform
- Identify Dependencies, Risks and Issues
- Define the timelines for final delivery

Sample workstreams to consider:

- Engineering and integration
- Feature workshops & development
- User training and on-boarding
- Pricing Model Build
